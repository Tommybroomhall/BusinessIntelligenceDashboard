## üìä OVERVIEW PAGE ISSUES

### Issue 3: Average Order Value Period Verification
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/sales-overview.tsx` (lines 270-279) & `server/routes/dashboard/sales.ts` (lines 34-36)
**Problem:** Need to verify that Average Order Value calculation respects the selected time frame (7d/30d).
**Expected:** AOV should calculate based on the selected period (7 days or 30 days) from the time frame selector.
**Code Reference:** Check if `calculateAverageOrderValue()` in storage layer uses the date range parameters correctly.

### Issue 4: Sales Analytics Graph Data Accuracy
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/sales-chart.tsx` & `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` (lines 318-324)
**Problem:** Sales analytics graph not showing correct data and not tied to 7d/30d periods.
**Expected:** Graph should reflect the same time period as selected in the Sales Overview component.
**Code Reference:** `SalesChart` component needs to receive and respect time frame selection.

### Issue 5: Traffic Sources Data Investigation
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/traffic-sources.tsx` (lines 20-28, 157-167)
**Problem:** Traffic sources showing data but source is unclear, and not tied to 7d/30d periods.
**Expected:** Investigate data source (Google Analytics vs Vercel Analytics) and implement period filtering.
**Code Reference:** Component queries `/api/traffic/analytics` but doesn't pass time period parameters.

### Issue 6: Sales Distribution UI Cleanup
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/traffic-channels-chart.tsx` (lines 32-44)
**Problem:** Sales distribution section UI needs improvement - text sizing and overall cleanliness.
**Expected:** Improve typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy for better readability.
**Code Reference:** Review tooltip and chart styling in the component.

### Issue 7: Activity Feed Icon Diversity
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/activity-feed.tsx` (lines 30-45)
**Problem:** Activity Feed only has icons for "order" and "system" types. Needs more diverse icons for different activity types.
**Expected:** Add specific icons for different activities (payments, shipments, customer actions, etc.).
**Code Reference:** `getActivityIcon()` function only handles two activity types.

### Issue 8: Popular Products "View All" Button
**File:** `client/src/components/dashboard/popular-products.tsx` (lines 108-113)
**Problem:** "View All Products" button doesn't work - no click handler or navigation.
**Expected:** Button should navigate to the Products page or open a modal with all products.
**Code Reference:** Button has no `onClick` handler or navigation logic.

## üîç HEADER ISSUES

### Issue 9: Global Search Bar Implementation
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/topbar.tsx`
**Problem:** No global search functionality exists in the header.
**Expected:** Implement a dynamic search bar that searches across all MongoDB collections (customers, products, orders, etc.).
**Code Reference:** Need to add search input component and implement backend search endpoints.

### Issue 10: Notification System Enhancement
**File:** `client/src/components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx` (lines 49, 165-172)
**Problem:** Notifications not loading all types (unread messages, order fulfillment, etc.).
**Expected:** Ensure all notification types are properly fetched and displayed.
**Code Reference:** Check notification filtering and data fetching logic.

### Issue 11: Admin Profile Dropdown
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/topbar.tsx` (lines 72-88)
**Problem:** Admin name/avatar section is not clickable and shows no dropdown menu.
**Expected:** Add dropdown menu with profile options, settings, logout, etc.
**Code Reference:** Avatar section needs click handler and dropdown menu component.

### Issue 12: Connection Status & Time Display
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/topbar.tsx`
**Problem:** Header lacks connection status indicator and current date/time display.
**Expected:** Add real-time connection status (online/offline) and live clock display.
**Code Reference:** Need to add connection monitoring and time display components.

## üì± SIDEBAR ISSUES

### Issue 13: Responsive Sidebar Behavior
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` & `client/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (lines 182-197, 226-241)
**Problem:** Sidebar doesn't collapse/recede on small screen sizes properly.
**Expected:** Implement proper responsive behavior with collapsible sidebar for mobile.
**Code Reference:** Check responsive classes and mobile behavior in sidebar components.

### Issue 14: Sidebar Section Organization
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` (lines 75-124)
**Problem:** Sidebar sections ("ACCOUNT", "DASHBOARDS", "PAGES") don't make sense and don't match content.
**Expected:** Reorganize into logical groups without confusing headers, similar to Shopify admin.
**Code Reference:** Restructure navigation sections and remove misleading headers.

### Issue 15: Shopify-Style Sidebar Design
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
**Problem:** Current sidebar doesn't follow Shopify admin dashboard styling.
**Expected:** Implement Shopify-inspired design with proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.
**Code Reference:** Update entire sidebar component styling and layout.

### Issue 16: Profile/Settings Placement & Styling
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` (lines 117-124)
**Problem:** Profile and Settings should be at bottom with icon-only design for cleaner look.
**Expected:** Move to bottom of sidebar, use only icons without text labels.
**Code Reference:** Relocate profile/settings links and update styling.

### Issue 17: Communications Page Addition
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` & routing system
**Problem:** Missing Communications page for emails and customer messages.
**Expected:** Add new Communications page to sidebar navigation and implement the page.
**Code Reference:** Add navigation link and create new page component for customer communications from MongoDB.
