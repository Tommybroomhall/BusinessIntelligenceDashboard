### Purpose

This plan ensures the implementation of a **Product Details/Edit Dialog** for the Products page, following the same style and structure as existing dialogs (e.g., CustomerDetailsDialog), with strict adherence to the MongoDB schema and a zero-assumption, evidence-based approach.  
**Every step is checkable and must be verified before proceeding.**

---

### 1. **Schema and API Contract Verification**

- [x] **Confirm MongoDB Product Schema**  
  - Fields: `tenantId`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `costPrice`, `category`, `imageUrl`, `supplierUrl`, `stockLevel`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `isActive`
- [x] **Confirm Frontend Product Type matches backend**
- [x] **Confirm GET /api/products/:id and PATCH /api/products/:id endpoints exist and return correct data**

---

### 2. **UI/UX Review and Dialog Scaffolding**

- [x] **Review CustomerDetailsDialog and AddProductDialog for style/structure**
- [x] **Add click handler to product table rows to open ProductDetailsDialog**
- [x] **Scaffold ProductDetailsDialog with live data, editable fields, Save/Cancel, and error handling**
  - **Note:** Dialog opens, loads live data, and all fields are editable. Save/Cancel logic works. Error handling is robust and visible. No mock data is present.

---

### 3. **Debug API Response and Client Fetch Logic**

- [x] **Investigate why /api/products/:id returns HTML instead of JSON in some cases**
- [x] **Fix client fetch logic or backend route as needed**
  - **Note:** Implemented missing GET /api/products/:id route. Confirmed all fetches now return correct JSON.

---

### 4. **UI/UX Consistency**

- [x] **Design ProductDetailsDialog to match established dialog patterns**
  - Dialog uses `<Dialog>`, `<DialogContent>`, `<DialogHeader>`, `<DialogTitle>`, etc.
  - All fields are editable, including image upload. Design matches AddProductDialog and CustomerDetailsDialog.

---

### 5. **Frontend Implementation**

- [x] **Create ProductDetailsDialog component**
  - [x] Fetch product data by ID on open (use react-query, loading state, error state)
  - [x] Display all product fields (all editable)
  - [x] Save/Cancel buttons work as expected
  - [x] Validate fields using the same schema as AddProductForm
  - [x] On save, call PATCH/PUT /api/products/:id and update MongoDB
  - [x] On success, close dialog and refresh product list

---

### 6. **Backend Implementation**

- [x] **Implement GET /api/products/:id if missing**
- [x] **PATCH/PUT /api/products/:id updates product in MongoDB**
  - [x] Validate input against schema
  - [x] Update only allowed fields
  - [x] Return updated product

---

### 7. **Testing and Verification**

- [x] **Test dialog opens and loads correct product data**
- [x] **Test editing and saving updates product in MongoDB**
- [x] **Test error handling (network errors, validation errors)**
- [x] **Test UI matches style of other dialogs**
- [x] **Test all fields (including optional ones) are handled correctly**
- [x] **Test product list refreshes after edit**

---

### 8. **Zero-Assumption Checklist**

- [x] **Every field in the dialog matches the MongoDB schema**
- [x] **No field is omitted or added without schema evidence**
- [x] **No API call is made unless endpoint is proven to exist**
- [x] **No UI/UX pattern is invented—only reused from existing dialogs**
- [x] **No data is mocked—everything is live from MongoDB**

---

### 9. **Breadcrumbs and Documentation**

- [x] **Add top-of-file docstring to ProductDetailsDialog**
- [x] **Inline comments for any non-obvious logic**
- [x] **Document any backend changes (new endpoints, schema changes)**
- [x] **Update PLAN.md as each step is completed**

---

**Final Note:**
- The Product Details/Edit Dialog is fully implemented, robust, and matches all requirements. All data is live, all fields are editable, error handling is visible, and the UI/UX is consistent with the rest of the dashboard. No mock data remains in the codebase.

**Breadcrumb for future:**
- If new product fields or business rules are added, update both the schema and dialog accordingly, and tick off new plan steps as needed.

**This plan is the single source of truth.  
No step is skipped, no assumption is made, and every box must be ticked with evidence.**
