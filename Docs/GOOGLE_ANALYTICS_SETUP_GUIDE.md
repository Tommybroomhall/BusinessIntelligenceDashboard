4. **Create Key**:
   - Click on your new service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab ‚Üí "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create New Key"
   - Choose "JSON" format
   - Download the JSON file securely

### Step 4: Extract Service Account Credentials

From your downloaded JSON file, extract these values:
```json
{

   - Notify user: Uncheck (it's a service account)
4. **Save**: Click "Add"

## Part 4: Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Create/update your `.env` file with these values:

```bash
# Client-side tracking (for website analytics)
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Server-side GA4 Data API (for dashboard analytics)
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=analytics-dashboard-service@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID
- Replace `123456789` with your actual Property ID
- Use the exact values from your service account JSON
- Keep the private key quotes and newline characters intact

### Step 2: Test Configuration

## Part 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Missing environment variables"**
- Check your `.env` file exists and has all required variables

**‚ùå "Failed to connect to Google Analytics"**
- Verify your service account email is added to GA4 with Viewer permissions
- Check that the Google Analytics Data API is enabled in Google Cloud
- Ensure your private key format is correct (includes newlines)

**‚ùå "Property not found"**
- Double-check your Property ID is numeric (not the Measurement ID)
- Verify the service account has access to the correct GA4 property

**‚ùå "No data available"**
- New GA4 properties may take 24-48 hours to show data
- Ensure your website has the GA4 tracking code installed
- Check that your website has recent traffic

### Data Delays

- **Real-time data**: Available within minutes
- **Standard reports**: 24-48 hour delay for new properties
- **API data**: Usually available within 4-6 hours
- **Historical data**: Available immediately for existing properties

### Testing with Sample Data

If you need to test before real data is available:

1. **Visit Your Website**: Generate some test traffic
2. **Use GA4 Debugger**: Install GA4 debug extension
3. **Check Real-time Reports**: Verify tracking in GA4 real-time view
4. **Wait for Processing**: Allow 4-6 hours for API data availability

## Part 6: Next Steps

4. **Performance**: Check dashboard loading times

### Security

1. **Rotate Keys**: Regularly rotate service account keys
