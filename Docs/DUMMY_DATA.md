# MongoDB Dummy Data Generator

This document explains how to use the dummy data generator script for the Business Intelligence Dashboard.

## Overview

The `load-dummy-data.ts` script creates a comprehensive set of dummy data in the MongoDB database for development and testing purposes. This data includes:

- Tenants (clients)
- Users
- Products
- Customers
- Orders and Order Items
- Traffic Data
- Activity Logs

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure MongoDB is properly configured in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MONGODB_USERNAME=your_mongodb_username
   MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
   MONGODB_CLUSTER=your_cluster.mongodb.net
   MONGODB_DATABASE=businessdash
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Script

You can run the script using the following command:

```bash
npm run db:load-dummy-data
```

This will:
1. Connect to your MongoDB database
2. Clear existing data (optional, controlled by CONFIG.CLEAR_EXISTING_DATA in the script)
3. Create new dummy data for all collections

### Configuration

You can modify the amount of data generated by editing the CONFIG object in the `scripts/load-dummy-data.ts` file:

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  TENANTS: 3,                  // Number of tenants (clients)
  USERS_PER_TENANT: 5,         // Number of users per tenant
  PRODUCTS_PER_TENANT: 30,     // Number of products per tenant
  CUSTOMERS_PER_TENANT: 50,    // Number of customers per tenant
  ORDERS_PER_TENANT: 100,      // Number of orders per tenant
  TRAFFIC_DATA_DAYS: 30,       // Days of traffic data to generate
  ACTIVITY_LOGS_PER_TENANT: 100, // Number of activity logs per tenant
  CLEAR_EXISTING_DATA: true    // Whether to clear existing data before generating new data
};
```

## Generated Data

### Tenants

The script creates multiple tenants (clients), including one main tenant with fixed data:

- **Main Tenant**: BusinessDash Inc.
  - Email: info@businessdash.com
  - Phone: +1 (555) 123-4567
  - Address: 123 Main St, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94105
  - Website: https://www.businessdash.com

Additional tenants are created with randomized data.

### Users

For each tenant, the script creates multiple users with different roles. For the main tenant, it creates an admin user with fixed credentials:

- **Admin User**:
  - Email: admin@businessdash.com
  - Password: password123
  - Name: Jane Smith
  - Role: admin

Additional users are created with randomized data and roles.

### Products

For each tenant, the script creates multiple products with:
- Name
- Description
- Price
- Cost Price
- Category
- Stock Level
- Image URL (placeholder)

### Customers

For each tenant, the script creates multiple customers with:
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Location
- Total Spent
- Order Count
- Last Order Date
- Status

### Orders and Order Items

For each tenant, the script creates multiple orders with:
- Order Number
- Customer Name
- Customer Email
- Amount
- Status
- Creation Date
- Update Date

Each order has multiple order items linking to products.

### Traffic Data

For each tenant, the script creates traffic data for multiple pages over a period of time, including:
- Page Views
- Unique Visitors
- Bounce Rate
- Traffic Source
- Medium
- Campaign
- Device Type

### Activity Logs

For each tenant, the script creates activity logs for various actions performed by users, including:
- Login/Logout
- Product Creation/Update/Deletion
- Order Creation/Update
- Customer Creation/Update

## Important Notes

1. This script is intended for development and testing purposes only.
2. All generated data is fictional and should not be used in production.
3. The script will clear existing data by default. Set `CLEAR_EXISTING_DATA: false` in the CONFIG object if you want to preserve existing data.
4. The script may take several minutes to run depending on the amount of data being generated.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check your MongoDB connection settings in the `.env` file
2. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
3. Check for any error messages in the console output
4. Try reducing the amount of data being generated by adjusting the CONFIG values
