## Client Onboarding Process

Once the white-labeling system is complete, we'll need a streamlined process for onboarding new clients:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Create tenant record in database
   - Configure primary branding (name, logo, colors)
   - Set up custom domain (if applicable)

2. **Customization**
   - Apply client branding throughout the dashboard
   - Configure email templates
   - Set up API integrations (Stripe, Google Analytics)

3. **User Setup**
   - Create admin user account
   - Train client on user invitation process
   - Configure role-based permissions

4. **Data Import**
   - Import initial client data (if available)
   - Set up demo data if needed

5. **Training & Handoff**
   - Provide training session for client team
   - Share documentation and resources
   - Establish support channels

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates

The current schema includes tenant customization fields, but we may need to extend it:

```sql
-- Potential additions to tenants table
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN custom_domain TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN secondary_color TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN favicon_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN email_template_id INTEGER;
```

### CSS Variable Strategy

We'll need to dynamically generate CSS variables based on the tenant's primary color:

```javascript
// Generate a complete color palette from primary color
function generateColorPalette(primaryColor) {
  return {
    primary: primaryColor,
    primaryLight: lightenColor(primaryColor, 0.2),
    primaryDark: darkenColor(primaryColor, 0.2),
    // Generate complementary and accent colors
  };
}
```

### Deployment Considerations

For white-labeling with custom domains, we'll need:

1. Wildcard SSL certificate or automated certificate generation
2. DNS configuration documentation for clients
3. Proxy server to handle multiple domains pointing to the same application

## Conclusion

This project plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for completing the Business Intelligence Dashboard with robust white-labeling capabilities. By following this plan, we can deliver a highly customizable product that meets the branding needs of our clients while providing powerful business intelligence features.
